# Email Verifier Tool in GoLang

## Overview
This project is a simple yet effective Email Verifier Tool developed in GoLang. It aims to validate email addresses by performing various checks on the domain, MX records, SPF records, and optionally DMARC records. The tool provides users with increased confidence in the validity of email addresses they input.

## How It Works
1. **User Input**: Users are prompted to enter an email address for verification.
2. **Domain Name Check**: The program extracts the domain name from the provided email address using basic GoLang packages like `bufio` and `strings`.
3. **MX Records Check**: Utilizing the `net` package, the tool performs DNS lookups to verify the presence of valid Mail Exchange (MX) records for the domain.
4. **SPF Records Check**: Through DNS queries, the program ensures the existence of a legitimate Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record associated with the domain.
5. **Optional DMARC Check**: Users have the option to include a check for Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) records for additional email authentication and reporting mechanisms.
